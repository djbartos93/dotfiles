# dotfiles
A set of dotfiles for OS X

## Basics.

These dotfiles are based on what I use as a new developer, this will continually change as I get more and more stuff. For now this is just a basic setup not changing any mac settings but used to sync my iTerm2 settings, Atom settings, and a few other programs (see below).

If you would like to use this feel free to fork and change things around the way you want. Soon I will have a detailed set of instructions for how to use my dotfiles settup.

## What this is doing.

Here is a list of stuff that is in here.

1. iTerm2 (beta v3) settings and profiles
2. Atom 1.0
3. homebrew
4. wget
5. git settings

more coming soon.
